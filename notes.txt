---------
Space time complexity- amount of time/space taken by the algorithm to run as a function of the input size

from lower time to higher time
O(1)- finding largest element in the sorted array
O(N)- printing elements in a array
O(NlogN)- merge sort
O(N^2) -  sorting
O(N^3) - 
O(m^n) (exponential) - finding subsets

mergeSort(O(nlogn)) ->100(<1ms) 1000(3ms), 5000(8ms),10000(9ms), 50000(22ms)
bubbleSort(O(N2)) ->100(<1ms) 1000(6ms), 5000(68ms),10000(273ms), 50000(7724ms)
